# Hospital Data Monitoring & Archival System

This project includes two main shell scripts that interact with real-time patient
and resource monitoring logs generated by Python simulators that were provided in
the task.


## Task 1: Interactive Archival Script (`archive_logs.sh`)

### Description

This script helps archive active log files safely without interrupting data
collection. When run, it prompts the user to select which log to archive from the
following options:

1. Heart Rate (`heart_rate.log`)
2. Temperature (`temperature.log`)
3. Water Usage (`water_usage.log`)
4. 
### How It Works

- The user selects a log type by entering a number (1-3).
- The script validates the input using a while loop until the user enters the
collect number.
- It checks if the corresponding log file exists.
- It moves the active log to an archive folder with a timestamped filename.
- It creates a new empty log file so data collection can continue uninterrupted.
- The script also handles errors such as invalid input, missing log files, or
archive directory issues.

## Task 2: Intelligent Analysis Script (`analyze_logs.sh`)

### Description

This script analyzes log files to generate simple reports showing how many entries
each device has produced, along with timestamps.

### How It Works

- The user is prompted to select which log file to analyze (Heart Rate,
Temperature, or Water Usage).
- The script validates the user input.
- It counts the number of entries per device (for Heart Rate and Temperature logs).
- For Water Usage, which simulates only one device, it counts total entries.
- The script extracts the timestamp of the first and last entries.
- The results are appended to a cumulative report file
(`reports/analysis_report.txt`) with a timestamp for record keeping.

## Notes

- The Python simulators generate log files in the `active_logs/` directory.
- The scripts expect logs named `heart_rate_log.log`, `temperature_log.log`, and
`water_usage_log.log` for consistency.
- Make sure archive directories and report folders exist or are created before
running the scripts.
